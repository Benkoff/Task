        (1) If Bella is pausing for a view on the 86th floor, she doesnâ€™t move at all for
            one step, and in the next step will roll her die (after all, she is a cockroach
            too!) to (possibly) move.
        (2) Otherwise, Bella rolls her 6-sided die and does the following:
            (a) On a 1, 2, or 3, she moves down one floor.
            (b) On a 4, she moves up 2 floors.
            (c) On a 5, she moves up 3 floors.
            (d) On a roll of a 6, Bella doesn't move.
            (e) However, if Bella moves onto (or tries to move through) the 86th floor,
                she will stop on floor 86, and will pause for a view on the next step. (So
                if, for example, Bella was on floor 85 and rolled a 4, she would stop on
                floor 86 for a view on the next step, instead of progressing to floor 87.)
        If Bella rolled a 6, and was already on floor 86, she will still pause for a view on the next step.
        (Note that this means Bella will spend two time steps on floor 86, one for the step when she
        rolled a 6, and another when she pauses for the view, as described in (1) above.)
