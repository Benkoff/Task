Due: May 1st (last day of class) or during the final exam. (You must bring a laptop.)

You are to implement a complete chat system as discussed in class. The starting files,
ChatServer.java, DataObject.java and ChatFrame.java are in the project directory of the 
course web site along with a screenshot of the demonstration given in class.

You must modify the starting files to add the following features:

Announce entrances and exits:			10
Prepend user name to messages:			10

You must use the ChatFrame given. If you attempt to turn in something different, it will
not be accepted and you will earn a zero for the project.
